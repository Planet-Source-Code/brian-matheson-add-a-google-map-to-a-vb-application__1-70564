## Add a Google Map to a VB Application


</div>

### Description

This project demonstrates a quick and easy way to add mapping to a windows desktop application (with an available internet connection) using Google Maps as the basis and source for the map. The demonstration application will map a point by either its physical address or its latitude and longitude. Building the application does not require any sort of agreement or licensing with Google; there is no required API to invoke and using this approach it really won't take more than a few minutes to put a map into your Visual Basic 6 built desktop application.
